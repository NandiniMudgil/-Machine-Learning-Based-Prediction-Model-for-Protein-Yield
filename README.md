# -Machine-Learning-Based-Prediction-Model-for-Protein-Yield
This project focuses on implemented machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict and optimize protein yield from oilseeds using Python. I built an interactive GUI with Tkinter for real-time user input, model-based predictions, and graphical  display of results, enhancing user experience.
